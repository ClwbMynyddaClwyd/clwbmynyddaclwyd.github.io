# MEMBER BENEFITS

Benefits of club membership include:

A printed copy of the club magazine (The Clwydian) twice per year.

EVENTS AND COACHING
Access to all club events, at home and abroad. This includes club trips, social meets such as the summer BBQ, the winter slide show series and the subsidised annual dinner and presentation by a celebrity speaker.

Access to coaching and skill building. There is a wealth of climbing and mountaineering experience within the club. Our friendly members are happy to show new-comers the ropes whilst attending one of our meets. We also have a number of dedicated skill-building days throughout the year and in the summer we usually offer private coaching for rock climbers where members pay for expenses only.

ACCESS TO HEAVILY SUBSIDISED OUTDOOR COURSES.
The CMC is a member of the Outdoor Partnership which offers outdoor courses at highly subsidised prices (typically 60% discount) such as MLA, CWA, SPA. Funding is limited but there may typically be 6 courses a year available to club members on a first come - first served basis. Application must first be made to the OP and your application form must be countersigned by the CMC Chair or Secretary.
