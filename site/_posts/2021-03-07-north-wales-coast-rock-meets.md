During the Summer there is a North Wales coast evening rock meet every Tuesday night for a 4 month period from May to August and a different crag will be visited each week. The programme makes full use of the “A55 Sport Climbs” guide book. For Craig-y-Forwyn a free download is available from The Climbers Club website: [http://www.climbers-club.co.uk/downloads/forwyn_lr.pdf]

All welcome including prospective members.
