We hold walks & scrambles in North Wales at least every fortnight.

Any suggestions for future walks or offers of volunteering to co-ordinate a walk or scramble should be forwarded to the walks co-ordinators (David Evans and Mark Evans). Mark and David can be contacted by email via marktns@clwydmc.co.uk and tbc.

“G2**” refers to the scramble difficulty grade and quality rating. Scramble grades are G1-G3. If the scramble element does not appeal, a walking alternative may be available.

Most of the walks are on a Saturday to enable people who climb to go out with the club on the Sunday.

Details for each walk/scramble, including start times, are detailed on the Meets Page and notification of any changes will be included in the Meets and Outings section of the forum during the preceding week.

If there are any queries, please contact the co-ordinators. The itinerary may be modified on the day according to the conditions.

Note that the walks leader is essentially a co-ordinator and not an instructor or guide. Individuals are responsible for their own equipment, safety and suitability for the walk / scramble.
