The Thursday Evening Clwyd Rock meets are open to all current and prospective members. The venues are chosen to suit all grades of climbing ability and are spread across the area to give all a reasonable opportunity after work. They give a good mix of Trad and Sport climbing with some Bouldering when evenings are short and usually start from 6.00-6.30pm.

Details will appear in the club calendar and forum on the week of each meet. If bad weather is forecast with enough warning, then an indoor venue might be suggested on the forums. Post any questions on the forums initially or contact Rod Lloyd-Jones on 01978 820052.

One harness & helmet may be available on loan for new starters.

For details of venues and directions, see the local guidebook “Clwyd Rock” by Rockfax or UKC website.
