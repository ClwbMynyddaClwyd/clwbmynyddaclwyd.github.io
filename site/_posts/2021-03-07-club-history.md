Clwyd Mountaineering Club began its life as Denbighshire Mountaineering Club in 1969. The Club was formed by a small, active group of climbers of generally average ability, who wanted to establish a circle of friends with whom they could climb or walk in the hills regularly. In 1975, with the change of the County name, the Club became Clwyd Mountaineering Club. From these modest beginnings, the Club has grown and developed.

The club membership is typically between 100 and 200 members with climbing at standards ranging from V.Diff to E4. There are experienced mountaineers with up to 40 years of knowledge to call on, grade IV winter climbers, as well as more modest performers. Members tend to be multi-disciplinary and many forms of mountain activity are pursued from mountaineering and scrambling to ice and rock climbing at all grades. The relatively small membership and breadth of activity ensures that we remain a vibrant and friendly club.

This framework generates discussion and encouragement, an integral part of a climberâ€™s life. We have a membership of a variety of ages and abilities. We are one of the few local clubs to welcome novices, and we run regular training events.

In recent years some members have been heavily involved in new routing, crag development and guide book work. These have focused on local crags along the A55 corridor, particularly Penmaen Head, Llanddulas Cave and Castle Inn.

Clwyd MC is active with the BMC, via the Committee for Wales, and is also affiliated to the Snowdonia National Park Society. We help and advise on local access problems, and helping larger organisations with campaigning on many subjects, mainly related to mountain conservation.

It is Club policy to encourage and promote safe mountaineering (insofar as this is possible). Prospective Members should realise that there are risks in mountain sports, and you will be asked to sign a waiver accordingly when you complete your Membership Application Form. The Club cannot accept liability for any accident, however caused.
