Martin Worthy is the co-ordinator and will post details of the weekly climbing meet on the club bulletin board.

Meets are usually held in Snowdonia on a Sunday and in the past year we have visited (amongst others):

Y Moelwynion
The Idwal Slabs
Milestone Buttress
The Llanberis Pass
There is such a diverse range of climbing in Snowdonia, Martin knows it well and can choose a good location!

Existing and prospective members are welcome to attend.
