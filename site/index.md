# Croeso | Welcome
Thank you for visiting our website, we are a friendly club based in North Wales and affiliated to the BMC.

Please feel free to browse the site to get an idea of the activities we get involved in. Non members are welcome to attend up to 3 of the local climbing / walking meets prior to joining so that they can assess whether the club meets their needs. Other official club meets, trips and events are open to members only unless by invitation.

Details of membership and how to join can be found under the club info section. You can get in touch with us via the contact form or view the upcoming meets and turn up and meet people.

Although we only allow club members to contribute to the forums, we welcome you to register and see what we get up to on a daily basis.

The club has over 100 members, mostly spread through North Wales, but with members as far away as Birmingham and the USA. One third of our members are women and our age profile covers teens through to sixty-somethings.

It is club policy to encourage and promote safe mountaineering (insofar as this is possible). Prospective Members should realise that our primary activities are for climbers and walkers.
